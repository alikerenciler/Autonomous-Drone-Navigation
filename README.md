# Autonomous Drone Navigation

## In this repository, I try to find a solution for Autonomous Quadrotor Navigation

### IMPORTANT: All scripts and documents will be shared, after paper released  on Sage Journals!
This solution based on TSP (Travel Salesman Problem) and Visual Servoing approaches. For this reson the repository includes scripts of these aproaches.
Main requirement of the scripts are global points (x,y,z,yaw) in a list. The path planning aproach will handle by TSP up to 11 points in global cordinates. The Visual Servoing handle by low computation costed way of Position Oriented aproach of Visual Servoing method. 

The repositor includes:
-  Travel Salesman Script
-  Visual Servoing Geometry Image
-  Position Orianted Visual Servoing Script

These scripts are used in a project called "Path Planning and Vision Guided Autonomous Quadrotor Navigation for PV System Inspection via ROS Environment" and you can reach youtube link of the project implementation in ROS Gazebo simulation environment.
